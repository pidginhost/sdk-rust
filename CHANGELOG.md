# Changelog

All notable changes to the PidginHost Rust SDK are documented here.

This SDK is auto-generated from the [PidginHost API schema](https://www.pidginhost.com/api/schema/).
Version bumps reflect schema changes, not hand-written code changes.

## v0.11.0

> Versions v0.8.0 through v0.10.2 shipped without entries in this file. The
> [Go changelog](https://github.com/pidginhost/sdk-go/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
> records those schema changes; they apply to this SDK too.

### Changed (breaking)

- **`AttachIPv4` → `AttachIPv4Request`, `AttachIPv6` → `AttachIPv6Request`.** The server attach routes now have distinct request and response components, so the generated request types are renamed.
- **`POST /api/cloud/servers/{id}/detach-ipv4/` returns `ServerDetachIPv4Response`** instead of `DetachIPv4Response`. The `detached` field is unchanged. `DetachIPv4Response` still serves the standalone `POST /api/cloud/ipv4/{id}/detach/` route.
- **Six enum components renamed off content-derived names.** Where several serializers expose a field called `status`, `type` or `priority` over different choice sets, drf-spectacular was naming the component by hashing its values, so adding a single choice silently renamed the type. These are now pinned:

  | Was | Now |
  |-----|-----|
  | `Priority3cdEnum` | `TicketPriorityEnum` |
  | `Status03cEnum` | `InvoiceStatusEnum` |
  | `Status63aEnum` | `ServiceStatusEnum` |
  | `StatusA57Enum` | `ResourceStatusEnum` |
  | `StatusEf2Enum` | `TicketStatusEnum` |
  | `Type85bEnum` | `ClusterTypeEnum` |

  A one-time rename: the names no longer move when a choice set gains a value. `ClusterType.type` had already been renamed once this way (`Type2faEnum` → `Type85bEnum` when `beta` was added) and now shares the pre-existing `ClusterTypeEnum`, which carried the identical `dev`/`prod`/`beta` set under a second name.

### Added

- **`reboot` on `AttachIPv4Request` and `AttachIPv6Request`** (boolean, default `false`). A public address is written to the machine config and the guest OS only reads it while booting, so on a running server the address is inert until a restart. Set `reboot` to have the API issue that restart.
- **`reboot_required` and `rebooted` on `AttachIPv4Response` and `AttachIPv6Response`.** `attached` alone could describe a server that answers neither ping nor SSH on the new address; these say whether a restart is still owed and whether one was performed. A stopped server reports both `false` and is never booted just to pick the address up, and `reboot: true` on a rescue-mode or transitioning server keeps `reboot_required: true` rather than rebooting out of the rescue ISO.
- **`AttachIPv6Response`** is new. `POST /api/cloud/servers/{id}/attach-ipv6/` previously echoed the request body back, so there was no `attached` flag to check.
- **Rescue mode**: `POST /api/cloud/servers/{id}/rescue/enter/` and `.../rescue/exit/`, typed as `RescueEnterQueued` / `RescueExitQueued`.
- **Boot ISOs**: `GET /api/cloud/servers/{id}/boot-isos/` with `BootISO`, `PaginatedBootISOList`, and `IsoBootRequest`.
- **Glue / personal-DNS records**: `/api/domain/domain/{domain}/dns/` and `/api/domain/domain/{domain}/dns/{name}/`, typed as `DNSGlue` and `PaginatedDNSGlueList`.
- `TicketMessage`, `ServiceCompany`, `DestroyProtectionResponse`, and `CategoryEnum`.

### Fixed

- **`attach-ipv4` reports a missing field as a missing field.** Omitting `ipv4` returned `Object with address=None does not exist`, which reads as a bad address rather than a bad field name; it is now `400 {"ipv4": ["This field is required."]}`.
- **`attach-ipv6` rejects a conflicting address with a `400`** instead of `200` plus a message, so a failed attach no longer looks like a success. Re-attaching the address a server already has is idempotent.

### Notes

In this SDK, struct names match the component names; fields are snake_case (`reboot_required`).


## v0.7.0

### Added

- Floating IP support. New API groups `cloud_floating_ipv4` and `cloud_floating_ipv6` cover list, create, retrieve, destroy, plus the `authorize`, `unauthorize`, and `authorizations` actions. Floating IPs can be authorized on multiple servers simultaneously for customer-managed HA (keepalived/VRRP inside the guest).
- New models: `FloatingIPv4`, `FloatingIPv6`, `FloatingIPv4Create`, `FloatingIPv6Create`, `FloatingIPAuthorization`, `FloatingIPAuthorizeRequest`, and their authorize/unauthorize response types.

## v0.6.0

### Added

- `ServerAdd.user_data` field for cloud-init startup scripts (bash with shebang or `#cloud-config` YAML), max 64 KiB, Linux images only.

## v0.5.0

### Added

- `CHANGELOG.md` is now bundled with the generated package, mirroring the Go SDK practice.

### Changed

- Build pipeline overhauled: fail-fast schema validation, per-language smoke tests, single-click release approval gate.

### Notes

- No SDK API changes — generated from the same schema as 0.4.x.

## v0.4.1

### Changed

- Regenerated alongside the Go SDK 0.4.1 patch release (no functional changes for Rust).

## v0.4.0

### Added

- `Server.generation` field exposing the server hardware generation (e.g. `general-purpose`).
- New API endpoints: cloud generations, server packages by generation.
- `ServerAdd.no_network_acknowledged` for creating servers without public networking.

### Changed

- Regenerated from latest API schema.

## v0.3.0

### Added

- Kubernetes API: clusters, node pools, nodes, HTTP/TCP/UDP routes.
- Billing API: funds, deposits, invoices, services, subscriptions.
- Dedicated servers API.
- FreeDNS API.
- Hosting API.
- Support tickets API.
- Domain API: registrants, transfers, nameservers, TLD listing.

### Changed

- Regenerated from latest API schema with full API coverage.

## v0.2.0

### Added

- Cloud compute: servers, images, packages, volumes, firewalls, IPs, networks.
- Account management: profile, SSH keys, API tokens.
- Convenience wrapper: `pidginhost_sdk::client::PidginHost`.
