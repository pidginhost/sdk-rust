# Changelog

All notable changes to the PidginHost Rust SDK are documented here.

This SDK is auto-generated from the [PidginHost API schema](https://www.pidginhost.com/api/schema/).
Version bumps reflect schema changes, not hand-written code changes.

## v0.13.0

### Added

- **Kubernetes port forwards can be called at all now.** All six routes under
  `/api/kubernetes/clusters/{cluster_id}/port-forwards/` generated with no
  request body and no response model, so this SDK could reach none of them.
  They now expose `KubernetesClustersPortForwardsList`, `...Retrieve`,
  `...Create`, `...Update`, `...PartialUpdate` and `...Destroy`, with the new
  `K8sPortForward`, `PatchedK8sPortForward`, `PaginatedK8sPortForwardList` and
  `ProtocolEnum` models.
- **Gateway route listings are typed and paginated**: `PaginatedHTTPRouteList`,
  `PaginatedTCPRouteList` and `PaginatedUDPRouteList`. The list and detail
  reads previously had no response schema at all.
- `NodeMetricsResponse` gained `disk` and `maxdisk`, which the endpoint has
  always returned but never documented.
- The node RRD route documents the `timeframe` query parameter it accepts
  (`hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`, `year`), so a window other than the default
  is now reachable.

### Changed

**This release is breaking.** Every change below corrects a type the API was
already sending -- the previous declarations did not describe the wire, so the
affected responses could not be decoded.

- `KubernetesClusters{Httproutes,Tcproutes,Udproutes,PortForwards}Retrieve2`
  are **removed**. Those names existed only because the list and detail reads
  collided on one operation id while the schema was incomplete. The list reads
  are now `...List`; the detail reads are `...Retrieve`.
- `KubernetesClusters{Httproutes,Tcproutes,Udproutes}Retrieve` **changed
  meaning**: it was the list read and is now the detail read. The signature
  changed with it, so this surfaces at compile time rather than silently.
- `NodeMetricsResponse.mem`, `.maxmem`, `.netin` and `.netout` widened from `i32` to `i64`.
  They are byte counts: a node with 2 GiB of memory reports 2147483648, one
  past the 32-bit range, so these responses failed to decode on essentially
  every real node.
- `ClusterDetail.dual_stack` and `.talos_upgrade_available` are **booleans**,
  `.storage_quota_gb` is an **integer**, `.last_pool_used_bytes` is a **64-bit
  integer** and `.price_per_hour` is a **number** -- all five were declared as
  strings while sending a bool or a number, which made the whole cluster object
  undecodable.

## v0.12.1

### Fixed

- **Release plumbing only -- no API or generated-code changes from v0.12.0.**
  v0.12.0 never reached PyPI: `publish-python` deleted the GitHub Actions
  workflow that uploads there, then logged an instruction to go and trigger it.
  The workflow is now versioned in the sdk repo and injected during generation,
  and the job fails if it is missing rather than assuming.

  `verify-published.py` also asked Packagist about `pidginhost/sdk` while the
  generator publishes `pidginhost/sdk-php`, so a correct PHP release was
  reported as a failure. Registry names are now read from the generated
  manifests instead of being written down twice.

  This version exists so every registry serves the same one.

## v0.12.0

### Changed (breaking)

- **The eight `/api/cloud/buckets/` routes now describe their real request and
  response bodies.** The bucket viewset advertised its fully read-only `Bucket`
  serializer as the body of every route, so `create`, `resize` and `visibility`
  documented no writable field to send, and `credentials/reveal` and
  `credentials/rotate` claimed to return `Bucket` while really returning an
  access key and secret. Any client that trusted the documented shape
  read a credential response that could not contain credentials -- and on
  `rotate` the old keys are already invalidated by then.

  New components: `BucketCreate` (`name`, `quota_gb`, `public_read`),
  `BucketResize` (`quota_gb`), `BucketVisibility` (`public_read`),
  `BucketCredentials` (`bucket`, `endpoint`, `region`, `access_key`,
  `secret_key`) and `BucketCancelResponse` (`id`, `status`). `create` documents
  the `202` it really answers; `DELETE` returns `202` with a body rather than
  `204`; the two credential routes take no request body and declare
  `Cache-Control: no-store`.

### Fixed

- Generator bumped to openapi-generator 7.24.0. No API shapes changed for this
  SDK; decimal fields were already generated as strings here.

  The Go and PHP SDKs were mapping `type: string, format: decimal` to a float
  and could not decode the values the API actually sends. That is fixed in
  their v0.12.0, and a CI contract check now asserts the invariant for all five
  languages so it cannot regress silently.

## v0.11.0

> Versions v0.8.0 through v0.10.2 shipped without entries in this file. The
> [Go changelog](https://github.com/pidginhost/sdk-go/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
> records those schema changes; they apply to this SDK too.

### Changed (breaking)

- **`AttachIPv4` → `AttachIPv4Request`, `AttachIPv6` → `AttachIPv6Request`.** The server attach routes now have distinct request and response components, so the generated request types are renamed.
- **`POST /api/cloud/servers/{id}/detach-ipv4/` returns `ServerDetachIPv4Response`** instead of `DetachIPv4Response`. The `detached` field is unchanged. `DetachIPv4Response` still serves the standalone `POST /api/cloud/ipv4/{id}/detach/` route.
- **Six enum components renamed off content-derived names.** Where several serializers expose a field called `status`, `type` or `priority` over different choice sets, drf-spectacular was naming the component by hashing its values, so adding a single choice silently renamed the type. These are now pinned:

  | Was | Now |
  |-----|-----|
  | `Priority3cdEnum` | `TicketPriorityEnum` |
  | `Status03cEnum` | `InvoiceStatusEnum` |
  | `Status63aEnum` | `ServiceStatusEnum` |
  | `StatusA57Enum` | `ResourceStatusEnum` |
  | `StatusEf2Enum` | `TicketStatusEnum` |
  | `Type85bEnum` | `ClusterTypeEnum` |

  A one-time rename: the names no longer move when a choice set gains a value. `ClusterType.type` had already been renamed once this way (`Type2faEnum` → `Type85bEnum` when `beta` was added) and now shares the pre-existing `ClusterTypeEnum`, which carried the identical `dev`/`prod`/`beta` set under a second name.

### Added

- **`reboot` on `AttachIPv4Request` and `AttachIPv6Request`** (boolean, default `false`). A public address is written to the machine config and the guest OS only reads it while booting, so on a running server the address is inert until a restart. Set `reboot` to have the API issue that restart.
- **`reboot_required` and `rebooted` on `AttachIPv4Response` and `AttachIPv6Response`.** `attached` alone could describe a server that answers neither ping nor SSH on the new address; these say whether a restart is still owed and whether one was performed. A stopped server reports both `false` and is never booted just to pick the address up, and `reboot: true` on a rescue-mode or transitioning server keeps `reboot_required: true` rather than rebooting out of the rescue ISO.
- **`AttachIPv6Response`** is new. `POST /api/cloud/servers/{id}/attach-ipv6/` previously echoed the request body back, so there was no `attached` flag to check.
- **Rescue mode**: `POST /api/cloud/servers/{id}/rescue/enter/` and `.../rescue/exit/`, typed as `RescueEnterQueued` / `RescueExitQueued`.
- **Boot ISOs**: `GET /api/cloud/servers/{id}/boot-isos/` with `BootISO`, `PaginatedBootISOList`, and `IsoBootRequest`.
- **Glue / personal-DNS records**: `/api/domain/domain/{domain}/dns/` and `/api/domain/domain/{domain}/dns/{name}/`, typed as `DNSGlue` and `PaginatedDNSGlueList`.
- `TicketMessage`, `ServiceCompany`, `DestroyProtectionResponse`, and `CategoryEnum`.

### Fixed

- **`attach-ipv4` reports a missing field as a missing field.** Omitting `ipv4` returned `Object with address=None does not exist`, which reads as a bad address rather than a bad field name; it is now `400 {"ipv4": ["This field is required."]}`.
- **`attach-ipv6` rejects a conflicting address with a `400`** instead of `200` plus a message, so a failed attach no longer looks like a success. Re-attaching the address a server already has is idempotent.

### Notes

In this SDK, struct names match the component names; fields are snake_case (`reboot_required`).


## v0.7.0

### Added

- Floating IP support. New API groups `cloud_floating_ipv4` and `cloud_floating_ipv6` cover list, create, retrieve, destroy, plus the `authorize`, `unauthorize`, and `authorizations` actions. Floating IPs can be authorized on multiple servers simultaneously for customer-managed HA (keepalived/VRRP inside the guest).
- New models: `FloatingIPv4`, `FloatingIPv6`, `FloatingIPv4Create`, `FloatingIPv6Create`, `FloatingIPAuthorization`, `FloatingIPAuthorizeRequest`, and their authorize/unauthorize response types.

## v0.6.0

### Added

- `ServerAdd.user_data` field for cloud-init startup scripts (bash with shebang or `#cloud-config` YAML), max 64 KiB, Linux images only.

## v0.5.0

### Added

- `CHANGELOG.md` is now bundled with the generated package, mirroring the Go SDK practice.

### Changed

- Build pipeline overhauled: fail-fast schema validation, per-language smoke tests, single-click release approval gate.

### Notes

- No SDK API changes — generated from the same schema as 0.4.x.

## v0.4.1

### Changed

- Regenerated alongside the Go SDK 0.4.1 patch release (no functional changes for Rust).

## v0.4.0

### Added

- `Server.generation` field exposing the server hardware generation (e.g. `general-purpose`).
- New API endpoints: cloud generations, server packages by generation.
- `ServerAdd.no_network_acknowledged` for creating servers without public networking.

### Changed

- Regenerated from latest API schema.

## v0.3.0

### Added

- Kubernetes API: clusters, node pools, nodes, HTTP/TCP/UDP routes.
- Billing API: funds, deposits, invoices, services, subscriptions.
- Dedicated servers API.
- FreeDNS API.
- Hosting API.
- Support tickets API.
- Domain API: registrants, transfers, nameservers, TLD listing.

### Changed

- Regenerated from latest API schema with full API coverage.

## v0.2.0

### Added

- Cloud compute: servers, images, packages, volumes, firewalls, IPs, networks.
- Account management: profile, SSH keys, API tokens.
- Convenience wrapper: `pidginhost_sdk::client::PidginHost`.
